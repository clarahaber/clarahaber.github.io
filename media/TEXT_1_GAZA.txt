Germany and Israel are celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations. While this
celebration is important we feel one that ignores Israel's present is no more
honest than one that ignores Germany's past. We call upon the German Culture
Industry to answer...

Question 1: How can they not question the timing of events suggested by Israel's
Foreign Ministry when they are requested directly after the bombing of Gaza? The
exhibition at Martin Gropius Bau was announced by Israel's Foreign Ministry
less than 3 months after the bombing of Gaza. This tragedy took the lives of
over 2000 people. By Israel's own account 45% were civilians and by all other
accounts 69% to 76%.

According to Israel:  1,106 civilians of 2,157 total
Gaza Health Ministry: 1,617 civilians of 2,310 total
Average (UN & other): 1,620 civilians of 2,184 total
